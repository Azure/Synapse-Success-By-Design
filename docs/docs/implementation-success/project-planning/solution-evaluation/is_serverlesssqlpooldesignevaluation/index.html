</h1>
<p>Separation of storage and compute as a design principle for modern data
and analytical platforms and services has been a trend and frequently
used pattern since it provided cost savings and more flexibility in
on-demand scaling of your storage and compute independently. Synapse SQL
Serverless (Serverless SQL pool - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft
Docs) further extends this pattern and adds an important capability to
query your data directly from your data lake storage and not to worry
about compute management while leveraging self-service types of
workload.</p>
<p>The purpose of the following is to provide core guidance for
implementations and architectures that include Synapse SQL Serverless
pools and try to reduce blockers and frequently found on the course of
the implementation of modern data architectures based on Azure Synapse
or later in the production stages. <del>To be consistent with guiding
tenets of Well Architected Framework (Microsoft Azure Well-Architected
Framework - Azure Architecture Center | Microsoft Docs) that aim to
improve the quality of a workload we are going to try to reuse the main
pillars that will allow better structure of the information and also
help to introduce necessary checkpoints in the corresponding phases of
you project execution.</del></p>
<p>Before we dig into each one of the categories - Operational Excellence,
Performance Efficiency, Reliability and Security - make sure you have a
clear understanding of a future workload that you are aiming to land on
SQL Serverless. While in many cases pay-per-query and autoscaling
capabilities of querying data directly from your data lake storage are
frequent motivation points, design should fit the purpose therefore
validation of the type/s of workload would be a good starting point and
the first suggested checkpoint.</p>
<p>In the scope of the architecture, we typically expect data science,
exploratory analysis and self service purposes to be the main drivers
for SQL Serverless along with a need for flexible data sharing scenarios
across frameworks and technologies, especially when there are some
operational or technical impediments to extend ETL/ELT processes for
loading/unloading data to and from different engines and data stores.</p>
<p>Some use cases will drive extremely high concurrency to your Synapse SQL
Dedicated pools service (streaming or IoT with considerable number of
independent processing threads that produce write operations). That
scenario could potentially be a good fit for leveraging Data Lake and
SQL Serverless for part of your workload (raw area stream writes to Data
Lake and SQL Serverless based access to storage that requires most
recent data).</p>
<p>You want to validate if fast data ingestion, more immediate data
availability for exploration or reporting, flexibility in tools or
frameworks that need to deal with the data are required and relaxed SLAs
fit your use case/s and requirements. In many cases you will find a good
fit when Synapse SQL and Synapse Spark (What is Apache Spark - Azure
Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs) are being used on the same data and
there is no need to add additional complexity. Read more about sharing
metadata between SQL Serverless and Synapse Spark engine (Shared
metadata model - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs)</p>
<p>1.- Operational Excellence</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Environment</strong>: check if a single Synapse workspace fits your
security and organizational requirements. More than one might be
necessary in case you are obliged to segregate your production and
dev/test users and workloads.</p>
<p><strong>Model and change management</strong>: if more than a single Synapse
environment is required, consider placing critical scripts and DDLs
onto a repository and sync the environments via pull requests.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>: SQL Serverless per se does not require any special
deployment actions and you will have that service available on-demand
with every Synapse workspace. Check regional proximity of the service
and that of the Data Lake Storage Gen2 you access with SQL Serverless.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>: check if your testing routines can be put and automated
as part of your deployment pipelines by leveraging services like Azure
DevOps. If certain testing is bound to performance, check and ensure
stats have been created first by executing the benchmark workload
beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: check if build-in monitoring is sufficient and if some
external services need to put in place to store historical log data,
in order to be able to analyze changes in performance or allow you to
define alerting or triggered actions for specific situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.- Performance Efficiency</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike traditional database engines, SQL Serverless does not rely on
its own optimized storage layer and for that reason its performance is
strongly dependent on how data is organized in Azure Data Lake Storage
Gen2.</p>
<p>Having a design and organization of your data files that projects good
partitioning of your data, you can expect reliable performance of SQL
Serverless, however the dedicated SQL pools usually would outperform
the former and provide more flexibility in terms of tuning
capabilities and workload management. Consider this point carefully
when you have strict performance SLAs.</p>
<p><strong>Data Ingestion</strong>: check how data is stored in Data Lake Storage
Gen2, i.e., the file sizes, number of files, and folder structure have
an impact on performance. Keep in mind that while some file sizes
might work for SQL Serverless, but on the other side might impose
troubles for efficient processing or consumption by other engines and
applications.</p>
<p><strong>Data Placement</strong>: check if you can unify and define common pattern
for data placement and make sure that directory branching can support
your security requirements. There are a few common patterns that help
you keep your time series data organized. Whichever your choice is,
make sure that it also works with other engines and workloads like if
it can help partition auto-discovery for Spark applications and
external tables.</p>
<p><strong>Data Formats</strong>: there are number of choices and most probably you
will be dealing with different formats on different layers of your
Data Lake as each layer might need to support distinct types of
workloads (like heavy writes or where schema evolves frequently vs
others that should be more oriented for efficient exploration). Today
SQL Serverless in most cases will offer the best performance and
better compatibility feature-wise with Parquet format. Check your
performance and compatibility requirements what format works best in
your case, because while Parquet improves performance through better
compression and reduction of IO by reading only required columns
needed for the analysis, it requires additional compute and some
source systems do not natively support Parquet for export output
format which would lead for additional transformation steps in your
pipelines and/or dependencies in your overall architecture.</p>
<p>Data transformations and conversions into desirable format can be
easily and very efficiently achieved with Synapse Spark Pools - check
if you can leverage that service in your data pipelines.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong>: every industry is different, but in many cases, there
are certain data access patterns that will be common across most
frequent queries of your workload., i.e. filtering and aggregations by
dates, categories or geographies that are core to customers business.
Check your most common filtering criteria, relate these to how much
data is being read/discarded by top used queries and validate if the
information on Data Lake is organized that favors your exploration
performance expectations.</p>
<p>Check in your queries if you effectively eliminate unnecessary
partitions in your OPENROWSET path parameter or, in case of external
tables, if additional indexing is required.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that some tools like Power BI in addition can compensate
and provide an additional layer of caching (Query caching in Power BI
Premium - Power BI | Microsoft Docs) and compression techniques to
fit necessary datasets in memory and improve end user experience in
case of SQL Serverless - evaluate if tools with such characteristics
need to be also included in your architecture from the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3- Reliability</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: check if there are strict requirements for
availability. While there are no specific SLAs for serverless and
resources for query execution are being acquired on-demand, currently
there is 30 min timeout for query execution which might break the
expectations for your workload and appear to be a service problem. In
such cases check if some of the best practices have not been applied.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: SQL Serverless is mostly for read workloads, validate
if all consistency checks have been performed during the Data Lake
data provisioning and formation process. Keep on your radar new
capabilities like recent addition of Delta Lake open-source storage
layer which provides support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
Isolation and Durability) guarantees for transactions and it allows us
to implement effective lambda/kappa architectures to support both
streaming and batch use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: weigh on your disaster recovery requirements: SQL
Serverless does not have its own storage layer and that would require
handling snapshots and backup copies of your data mostly externally
(except situations when you can use CETAS to make copies of your
critical data referenced by external tables.). In many Data Lake
implementations there is always a way to recover/rebuild your data
from RAW (should be immutable) layers where you should keep the
required amount of historical data that could cover your worst-case
scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4- Security</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organization of your data is also important for building flexible
security foundations: in most cases different processes and users will
require different permissions and access to specific sub-areas or your
Data Lake or logical Data Warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Check if typical Raw, Stage and Curated data lake
areas need to be placed on the same Storage Account vs independent
Storage Accounts. The latter might result in more flexibility in terms
of roles and permissions and also adds additional IOPS capacity that
might be needed in case your architecture must support heavy and
simultaneous read/write workloads (potentially that could be a case of
real time or IoT scenarios). Validate if you need to further segregate
and keep your Sandboxed areas and Master Data areas on separate
Accounts as well. Most of the users will not need to update and delete
data and therefore do not need write permissions to your Data Lake,
except Sandboxed and private areas.</p>
<p>Check what requirements point down to features like <em>Always
Encrypted</em>, <em>Dynamic Data Masking</em> or <em>Row Level Security</em> and
availability of these in a specific scenario - like with OPENROWSET -
and anticipate potential workarounds in case these requirements might
be blocked by current feature availability.</p>
<p>Additionally, check what would be the best authentication methods,
i.e. AAD Service Principals, SAS, when and how Authentication
pass-through can be leveraged and integrated in the exploration tool
of choice of the customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5- Other considerations</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong>: check if you have put in place our best practices
and recommendations (Best practices for serverless SQL pool - Azure
Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs). Special attention for filter
optimization and proper collation for predicate push-down to work
properly.</p>
<p><del><strong>Service limits</strong>: additionally, check for current service limits
like number of SQL Serverless Pools (1) per workspace, max query
execution time (30 min), max number of columns that you can handle
with OPENROWSET (1024), or what T-SQL surface area is supported, DML
statements, etc.</del></p>
